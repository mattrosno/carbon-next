# Vacation Planning

So you're going on vacation, woohoo! <span aria-label="celebrate">ðŸ¥³</span> Here
are some things you should do before heading out and enjoying some well-earned
time off.

- [ ] Enter your time in [vPlanner](https://ibm.biz/BdZRkr)

After logging in, you should head on over to the **Carbon Design and
Development** team, find the relevant dates, and fill them out.

- [ ] _(Optional)_ Setup your email auto-response

You can do this in your email client by heading to the top-right hand side and
selecting your profile image, then going to **Mail and calendar settings**.

In this window, you can go to **Out of Office** and set the relevant dates and
message you would like to have sent out when folks email you.

- [ ] Set your Slack status

Slack has a setting for setting your status for a pre-determined amout of time,
what you choose as your status is up to you! Some common ones include the
defaults from slack, or `OOO until XX/YY`.

- [ ] Exclude yourself as a reviewer for your team on Pull Panda

To make sure reviews aren't being requested while you're on vacation, make sure
to head on over to [Pull Panda](https://pullpanda.com) and go to the
**Assigner** tab. From there, you can select your team. For each team there is
an **Excluded team members** section where you can add your name while you're
out. Don't forget to remove yourself from the Excluded team members section when
you get back!

- [ ] Delegate Pull Requests or Issue conversations that you're actively engaged
      in

If you're responsible for a review, or are actively engaging in an issue, make
sure to find an appropriate delegate while you're out so work isn't being
blocked.
