## Usage

`@carbon/icon-build-helpers` is a private module in the Carbon Design System
monorepo. The purpose of this module is to centralize tooling for:

- Searching a directory of `.svg` assets and structuring them in terms of size
  and prefixes
- Custom builders for various libraries, which currently include:
  - Vanilla
  - React
- Implementing repo status checks in CI around icon metadata files, namely
  `metadata.yml` and `categories.yml`

As a result, these file power the generation of the following SVG-based
projects:

- `@carbon/icons`
- `@carbon/icons-react`
- `@carbon/pictograms`
- `@carbon/pictograms-react`
